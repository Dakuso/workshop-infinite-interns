He now wants to see what the weather is like in his city to estimate how many customers are going to sit outside today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Need Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models excel at understanding and generating text, but to perform concrete actions, such as database queries, web searches, or file operations, they require external tools. Agents can then decide when to call them, parse results, and integrate tool outputs into their reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent = LLM + Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "An *agent* is a language model linked to tools, enabling it to think, act, and iterate until a task is complete. In this notebook we will be using the LangChain / LangGraph environment in order to run our code efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Slide5](./images/slides/Slide5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ReAct Pattern lets agents Reason and Act iteratively\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern interleaves model reasoning and external tool actions. Instead of sending a single prompt, the agent alternates between:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thought**: the model thinks about what to do next.\n",
    "2. **Action**: the model invokes a tool, such as a search or function call.\n",
    "3. **Observation**: the tool returns a result, which the model incorporates into its next thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop continues until the agent produces a final answer. ReAct enables LLMs to perform complex, grounded tasks by leveraging tools for information retrieval, computation, or external APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The LangChain Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) provides a unified interface for working with LLMs. It abstracts boilerplate for prompt handling, response parsing, and agent loops, allowing you to focus on building intelligent workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Slide6](./images/slides/Slide6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting Agents with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "![Slide4](./images/slides/Slide4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a workflow framework built on top of LangChain. It represents agentic interactions as graphs of nodes (e.g., LLM calls, tool invocations) and edges (state transitions). This design enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Declarative workflow definitions\n",
    "* Built-in state management and persistence\n",
    "* Flexible integration of custom and prebuilt tools\n",
    "* Support for multi-agent and branching workflows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Giovanni is impressed by the capabilities of his agent and wants to automate more processes in his pizzeria. He decides to try a multi-agent workflow because he read on the internet that it has many advantages over a single agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will build a multi-agent workflow using LangGraph. This example demonstrates how to create a workflow where multiple agents collaborate to solve a complex task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The many benefits of multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A single agent might struggle if it needs to specialize in multiple domains or manage many tools. By distributing tasks among multiple agents, we can achieve:\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent specializes in a specific subtask, improving modularity and maintainability.\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: Agents can operate concurrently, speeding up complex operations.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: New agents and tools can be added without impacting existing components.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Isolated failures donât bring down the entire workflow.\n",
    "- **Least Privilege**: Agents only have access to the tools they need, reducing security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "![Slide12](./images/slides/Slide12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiâagent systems, agents exchange information through âhandoffs,â a mechanism that specifies which agent takes over and what data is passed along. We are now going to build a multi-agent workflow for our example using the supervisor architecture.\n",
