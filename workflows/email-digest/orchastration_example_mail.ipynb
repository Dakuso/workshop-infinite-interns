       "Workload Assessment\n",
       "The current workload distribution shows significant variations across teams and individuals. Key findings include:\n",
       "- Peak periods creating bottlenecks in workflow\n",
       "- Uneven task allocation leading to overburden in some areas\n",
       "- Project deadlines often overlapping, causing resource constraints\n",
       "- Increasing complexity of assignments requiring additional time investment\n",
       "\n",
       "Work Environment Evaluation \n",
       "The physical and digital work environment impacts daily operations in several ways:\n",
       "- Office layout and ergonomics affecting comfort and focus\n",

       "- Technology infrastructure and tool accessibility\n",
       "- Remote work considerations and virtual collaboration challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "Personal Energy Management\n",
       "Individual energy levels and capacity show patterns that influence productivity:\n",
       "- Natural energy fluctuations throughout the workday\n",
       "- Impact of breaks and recovery periods on sustained performance\n",
       "- Stress levels and their effect on focus and efficiency\n",
       "- Work-life balance considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "Barriers to Optimal Performance\n",
       "Several obstacles have been identified that potentially limit peak efficiency:\n",
       "- Communication gaps between teams and departments\n",
       "- Process bottlenecks and administrative hurdles\n",
       "- Skill gaps requiring additional training or support\n",
       "- Time management challenges and interruption patterns\n",
